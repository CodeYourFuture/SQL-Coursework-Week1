## Homework

If you haven't completed all the exercises from this lesson then do that first.

### Tasks

1.  Which rooms have a rate of more than 100.00?
2.  List the reservations that have a checkin date this month and are for more than three nights.
3.  List all customers from cities that begin with the letter 'M'.

Insert some new data into the room_types and rooms tables, querying after each stage to check the data, as follows:

4.  Make a new room type of PENTHOUSE with a default rate of £185.00
5.  Add new rooms, 501 and 502 as room type PENTHOUSE and set the room rate of each to the default value (as in the new room type).
6.  Add a new room 503 as a PREMIER PLUS type similar to the other PREMIER PLUS rooms in the hotel but with a room rate of 143.00 to reflect its improved views over the city.

Using what you can learn about aggregate functions in the w3schools SQL classes (or other providers), try:

7.  The hotel manager wishes to know how many rooms were occupied any time during the previous month - find that information.
8.  Get the total number of nights that customers stayed in rooms on the second floor (rooms 201 - 299).
9.  How many invoices are for more than £300.00 and what is their grand total and average amount?
10. Bonus Question: list the number of nights stay for each floor of the hotel (floor no is the hundreds part of room number, e.g. room **3**12 is on floor **3**)
